    "- You can assume that there are sufficient registers to hold all variables in a function.\n",
    "- There is no global state.\n",
    "- The code in the ``main()`` function should be executed (using the ``start_:`` label in MIPS). You have to put ``.global _start`` at the beginning of the assembly code to ensure that the assembler finds this label.\n",
    "- All other functions can only be reached by calling them from ``main`` (possibly indirectly via other functions).\n",
    "- Use the ``$s0-$s7`` registers to store variables of the ``main()`` function. \n",
    "- Use the ``$t0-$t7`` registers for the variables of other functions.\n",
    "- Use ``$a0-$a3`` to store arguments. You can assume that there are not more than 4 arguments.\n",
    "- Use ``$v0`` to store the return value. The variable declared in the optional return statement at the end of each method should be returned in $v0.\n",
    "- Registers should be allocated in the order variables are introduced, starting with ``$s0/$t0``\n",
    "- You can use ``$t8`` and ``$t9`` for intermediate computations as we have done for SIMP.\n",

Remember, you should use the ``$t0-$t7`` registers for local variables (except for ``main()`` where ``$s0-$s7`` are used). \n",

    "### Part 3: Nested and Recursive Functions (3 Marks)\n",
    "Extend functions to allow recursive and nested calls. To achieve this, you need to develop a stack frame. As all variables are in registers, (when required) you will need to push a stack frame with all caller-save registers before the call is made and pop them back to the correct registers when control is returned to the caller.\n"
